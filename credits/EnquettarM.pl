# Writes a new string.tbl file
#
# Parameter: The string.tbl file to read, and the data file with stuff to change
#
# Data File format: either a or c as first character on each line
#   If a, then have two words in double quotes on that line, the key and the value
#   If c, then have 4 words in double quotes, the key/value pair to change and what to change it to.  If either of the pair to match are a null string (""), then just match the other one.  If either of the other pair are null, that item is not replaced.

# A intro to the string.tbl format.
#
# There are four main sections to the string.tbl file.
# First, the header.  This is 21 bytes long.
# Second, an array with two bytes per entry, that gives an index into the next table.  This allows lookups of strings by number.
# Third, a hash array, with 17 bytes per entry, which has the pointers to the key and value strings, and has the strings sorted basically by hash value.  This allows lookups of strings by key.
# Fourth, the actual strings themselves.

# Ondo made the original script, so most of the credit goes to him. I've just modified it 
# a bit. :)
#
# This modified version is designed to take the string.tbl and create a txt file that can viewed
# and changed in excel. This txt file will then be read in, and a new string.tbl file will be created.
#
# NOTE: New Usage: perl EnquettarM.pl -[e|i] [string.tbl to export from or txt file to import from]
# -e extract to txt file or -i import from txt file, anything else will print a help message
#  ex: perl EnquettarM.pl -e mystring.tbl
